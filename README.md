This is the final project for my Front-end Web development Course. I created a website for a book store, providing the options to sell second-hand books as well as purchase books. 
I started by creating the basic outline using HTML, and adding some styling using CSS. 
I added functionality using JavaScript, adding functions such as adding items to the shopping basket and having the basket total be responsive.
