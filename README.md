This is the final project for my Front-end Web development Course. I created a website for a book store, providing the options to sell second-hand books as well as purchase books. 
I started by creating the basic outline using HTML, and adding some styling using CSS. 
I added functionality using JavaScript, adding functions such as adding items to the shopping basket and having the basket total be responsive. 
 
What went well: I got a lot of the functionality of the JavaScript working which I am happy with.
Different Next time? I've re-started this project and started making a Final Project 2.0 as i thought the overall design of the website was dated and not eye catching.
